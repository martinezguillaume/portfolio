    "description": "I have been working since 2016 on Javascript development, and more particularly on React / React Native development, from the creation of the project architecture to its production, with even a UI / UX creation part for some. \nI have developed half a dozen mobile applications which are now on the stores as well as websites.\n\nI'm very familiar with React Native, I started developing mobile apps when this framework was in its beginning (2015/2016). For a mobile project, I am able to manage it until it is put into production on the stores with deployment automation. In addition, I know a lot about the Expo framework which I have also used a lot.",
